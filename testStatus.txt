Copied my much better test platform from tiny-obj where I developed it a few
years ago into this project. One test suite: Testjtc plus a nice testUsage.txt
document.

About testing...
The C version had a testMain with a huge switch to tests 1..94. But I did have
fragments of tc code starting with test 20. So in this java version early unit
tests were coded into various class main(..)s. For my sanity I kept tests from
20 up with the same numbers, e.g. 20.tc. The final result is a much simpler test
system: one small shell script 'r <number>' for run, plus a Tests directory with
numbered tc code. No huge switch.
