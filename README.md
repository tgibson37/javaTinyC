javaTinyC
---
My 1977 tiny-c was first done in 8080 assemble, later in C. This is a Java version.
Why two versions? C does not exist on all platforms. Its that simple. But also I
just wanted to do it. I've been a java coder since release zero, about 1995. and
its just fun. And I'm proud of my 45 year old invention.
